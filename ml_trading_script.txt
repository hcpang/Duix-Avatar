The sources provide a detailed framework for applying machine learning to financial trading, emphasizing that the goal is not to predict market movements but to identify high-probability trade entry points. The primary objective function for strategy success is the Sharpe Ratio, which measures risk-adjusted returns. A core breakthrough presented is that optimizing a single, perfect strategy is fraught with difficulty, such as overfitting and the trade-off between returns and volatility. Instead, the superior approach is strategic diversification. By creating a portfolio of many smaller, uncorrelated strategies, often by varying features or exit criteria, the portfolio's overall returns grow linearly while its risk, measured as standard deviation, grows sublinearly, maximizing the Sharpe Ratio. The final step involves optimizing capital allocation across this diverse suite of strategies to achieve the best collective performance.
